[JRubyArt][jruby_art] is a ruby wrapper for [processing-3.2.1][processing]. Create processing sketches in ruby using regular ruby-2.3 syntax, and use the magic [JRuby][jruby] to run them. You can use both rubygems and and regular processing libraries in your sketches. This package enables watch mode to be run from [Atom editor][atom].
