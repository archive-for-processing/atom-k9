This package enables watch mode to be run from [Atom editor][atom]. Much inspiration and some ideas stolen from [Ben Bleikamp][atom-processing], but hey this is way better, features [JRubyArt][jruby_art] watch mode.

[JRubyArt][jruby_art] is a ruby wrapper for [processing-3.2.1][processing]. Create processing sketches in ruby using regular ruby-2.3 syntax, and use the magic [JRuby][jruby] to run them. You can use both rubygems and and regular processing libraries in your sketches.
