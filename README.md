# JRubyArt in Atom

Watch JRubyArt sketches from Atom by pressing `ctrl+alt+shift+w` or using menu.

### Running a sketch from Atom

![atom menu]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/menu.png)

### Help Wanted

I'm no expert with javascript, creating a real atom-k9-spec.js would be a great help in the first instance. But menu driven links to resources/references would also be ace.
