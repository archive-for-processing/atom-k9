### Use snippets to create / edit a new sketch ###

Want to create a new sketch in the editor then install [language-jruby-art][language-jruby-art]

![Using the base snippet](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/86850/18607317/97e1d102-7cc1-11e6-9302-719b633d8dd1.gif)

There is absolutely no reason to not customise / extend this package (_and to share anything good of course_) eg the snippet needs modifying to to use with propane, but then you would use script runner instead of `atom-k9`.

### Using color-picker package ###

Want to know what the colors in sketch might look like, install [color-picker][colorpicker] by [Thomas Lindstrom][lindstrom]:-
