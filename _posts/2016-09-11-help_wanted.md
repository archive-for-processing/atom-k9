### ruby ###

I am self taught rubyist (after java, and a tiny bit of smalltalk), so I am still open to suggestions for improvements to [JRubyArt][jruby_art].

### javascript ###

I can barely understand javascript code, it seems quite alien to me, and I need help in developing [atom-k9][atom-k9]. I am somewhat amazed that my application actually works. What I did initially was to hack on a [processing runner][processing] [atom][atom] application by Ben Bleikamp to produce a working version. But I don't know coffeescript either (and now is probably not the time to learn), further [atom][atom] is moving away from it anyways (in favor of modern javascript), so I found a way to decaffeinate the project. However I'm in no position to check the javascript, or write suitable spec/tests, so I'm kind of hoping some enthusiastic person will help me out.
