### atom-k9 ###

Is an atom package that allows you to `--run` or `--watch` JRubyArt sketches without leaving the atom editor. Whilst the sketch is running in the `--watch` mode, you can edit the sketch, and it will re-load on save. _NB: make sure your sketch is not saved to a top level directory (we limit the number of files that can be watched, but you might wait a long time to find that out)_.

Check out the [JRubyArt GitHub repo][repo] and [getting started][started], for more info on how to get the most out of JRubyArt. File all bugs/feature requests at [JRubyArt issues][issues]. Also check out the learning [JRubyArt blog][blog]

### Starting atom ###

From your home directory fire up a terminal and type `atom` on return atom gets fired up and releases the terminal. Why not start from a window environment you may ask? Well it is the only sure way to pick up local envionmental variables eg path to gem binaries (like `k9`)
